# openldap_users should be an array of user objects with 3 properties: firstName, lastName and passwordHash
#
# At this point the role only supports SHA512 encryption and the passwordhash can be obtained using bash:
#  echo -n 'your_password' | openssl dgst -sha512 -binary | openssl enc -base64
#
#  for instance, for a username john.doe with password 'my_password' you would need
#
#  - firstName: John
#    lastName: Doe
#    passwordHash: "{SHA512}3ajDRohg3LJOIoq47kQgjUPrL1/So6U4uvvTnbT/EUyYKaZL0aRxDgwCH4pBNLai+LF+zMh//nnYRZ4t8pT7AQ=="
